# Adding a New Payment Gateway to Paid Memberships Pro

Note: The example gateway in this repository was added to GitHub over 10 years ago and is now outdated. It does not reflect the best practices for creating a custom gateway plugin with Paid Memberships Pro.

For a more up-to-date reference, we recommend reviewing the core PMPro gateway classes for [Stripe](https://github.com/strangerstudios/paid-memberships-pro/blob/dev/classes/gateways/class.pmprogateway_stripe.php) and [PayPal Express](https://github.com/strangerstudios/paid-memberships-pro/blob/dev/classes/gateways/class.pmprogateway_paypalexpress.php). These provide a solid foundation for developing a new gateway integration.

[This documentation page also outlines the steps to create a new gateway integration for PMPro](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/gateway/adding-a-new-gateway/).

Additionally, you can explore these standalone gateway plugins we maintain:

- [Paystack](https://github.com/strangerstudios/paystack-gateway-paid-memberships-pro)
- [Payfast](https://github.com/strangerstudios/pmpro-payfast)
- [CCBill](https://github.com/strangerstudios/pmpro-ccbill)

We are keeping this repository open for now and plan to update it with a fully functional example gateway class in the future.
